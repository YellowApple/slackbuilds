This is a repository for all SlackBuilds which I maintain.  Pull
requests and bug reports are welcome, whether here or by email / via
the SlackBuilds.org mailing list.

License varies depending on the SlackBuild.  I generally stick to the
default BSD/MIT-style license used in
the [SlackBuilds.org templates](https://slackbuilds.org/templates/),
but those inherited from other maintainers (`erlang-otp.SlackBuild`
and `couchdb.SlackBuild` as of the writing of this README) might have
their own licenses.
